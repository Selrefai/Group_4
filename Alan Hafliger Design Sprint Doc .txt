Goal/Product Vision 
* I guess the long term goals/product vision would be to design some kind of software that could help students while they are in school as well as help them be prepared to find a job after college. 
* The software should hopefully allow the students to find out more about career opportunities available to them. Whether that is further education, a job etc. 
* The software could also allow employers and schools to see recently graduated students along with credentials and be able to reach out to them. This would allow for a more open line of communication between hopeful graduates and businesses looking to hire them. 
Stakeholders
* other stakeholders could be businesses looking for graduating students
* Students looking to further their education 
* Students looking for career opportunities 
* Schools looking for Masters/Doctorate/etc. Students


Customer Discovery Questions:


* What is a service you feel is/is not provided and ways that it could be added/improved?
* In what ways would you like to pursue furthering your education/career? (Internship, Entry-Level Job, Extending your education, etc.)
* Why do you feel you are unprepared for what you want to do after graduation? And how could you be better prepared?
* What services are already provided that solve some aspect of your problem? How do they do that? 
* If you have already used these services, how do you think these services could be improved?
